# Getting Started with Totododo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Stacks üìö

- React
- React Datepicker
- Styled Components
- Supabase / Local Storage

## Branch üå≥

There are several branches on this project with the following purposes:

- simple-todo: todo app using state
- local-storage: todo app with data stored inside local storage
- supabase: todo app with data stored in supabase

## Quickstart ‚ö°Ô∏è

1. On `supabase` branch

   If you are on `supabase` branch, you need to copy `.env.example`, rename it to `.env.local`, create new supabase project and add your key. You can follow the docs [here](https://supabase.io/docs/guides/with-react).

   Then you can run `yarn start`.

1. On other branch

   You can simply run `yarn start` to start the app

## Available Scripts ‚öôÔ∏è

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
